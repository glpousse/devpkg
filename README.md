# Replication Package for Development Economics

As part of [Clément Imbert's](https://sites.google.com/site/clemimbert/) class in Development Economics, this project will use R to replicate  outputs from: 

*Mehmood, Sultan. 2022. "The Impact of Presidential Appointment of Judges: Montesquieu or the Federalists?" American Economic Journal: Applied Economics, 14 (4): 411–45.*

The project is pending, and will be updated throughout the term. Thanks for your patience!
