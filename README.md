# Replication Package for Development Economics

As part of [Clément Imbert's](https://sites.google.com/site/clemimbert/) class in Development Economics, this project will use R to replicate  outputs from: 

*Rossi, Federico. 2022. "The Relative Efficiency of Skilled Labor across Countries: Measurement and Interpretation." American Economic Review 112 (1): 235–66.*

The original data and code can be found [here](https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/project/146041/version/V1/view).

The project is ongoing, and will be updated throughout the term. Thanks for your patience!
